These measures facilitate a nuanced evaluation of factors such as the average patient visit duration, monthly visit patterns, total visits categorized by department referral, and the breakdown of patient visits by age group. 

Additionally, the utilization of DAX formulas aids in determining average satisfaction levels based on age group and potential race-based discrimination, as well as evaluating average wait times categorized by age group and patient race. The integration of these measures and DAX formulas enhances the depth and precision of our analysis, providing valuable insights to guide improvements in patient care and operational efficiency.

The insights gained from this report serve as a roadmap for healthcare providers to prioritize and address key areas for improvement, ultimately leading to a better patient experience and more efficient operations.
